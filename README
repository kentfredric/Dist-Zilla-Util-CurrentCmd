Dist::Zilla::Util::CurrentCmd

This module exists in case you are absolutely certain you want to have
different behaviors for either a plugin, or a bundle, to trigger on ( or
off ) a specific phase.

Usually, this is a bad idea, and the need to do this suggests a poor
choice of work-flow to begin with.

That said, this utility is *probably* more useful in a bundle than in a
plugin, in that it will be slightly more optimal than say, having an
"ENV" flag to control this difference.
